1: I initialize a Hashmap named map to store elements from the array nums as key, 
with their corresponding counts as value.

2: The loop iterates through array nums

3: For each element nums[i], the code check if it's already in the map.
- If it is not in the map, put that new value in the map and initialize with 1
- If if is already in the map, return false


Time Complexity:
- Initialization: Creating the "Hashmap" is O(1)
- Loop: The loop runs "n" times, where "n" is the length of the array nums
- HashMap operations: Both "containsKey" and "put" operations on a "HashMap" have an 
average time complexity of O(1)

Therefore, the overall time complexity is: O(n)


Space Complexity:
- HashMap Storage: In the worst case, if there are no duplicates, the HashMap will store n key-value pairs

Thus the space complexity: O(n)
