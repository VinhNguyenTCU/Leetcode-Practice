Use String builder to make a list of 16 
Change the given string to lower case and then change it into a character array
Then use for each loop to go through every element of the array, check whether it is digit or letter
If it's true then add the letter or digit to the StringBuilder
If it's false, then skip and and continue the for-each loop

Then create another while loop with left and right pointer
As long as the left pointer is smaller than the right pointer, compare the char at the two pointer
If two char are the same, then keep looping by increasing left by one and decreasing right by one
If the two char are different, then immediately throw false to the terminal

If the while loop continues to the end without meeting any false result, then return true for the whole loop.
