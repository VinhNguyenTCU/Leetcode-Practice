1: Create/ Initialize a Hashmap named map to store pair key-value and track indices of elements

2: Iterate through the array, check for any duplicates and if the difference between the current index and 
and stored index map.get(nums[i]) is less than or equal to k.

3: Otherwise, update the index of the new key-value pair into the map.

4: Return false if no nearby duplicate is found.

Time Complexity: 
- Iteration: the method iterates through the array nums once, resulting in time complexity of O(n) where n is the number 
of elements of nums

- Each operation on the HashMap (containsKey, get, put) is O(1) on average due to the underlying hash table
implementation.

--> Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n).

Space Complexity:
- The HashMap stores at most n elements in the worst case, where n is the length of the array

--> Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(n).
