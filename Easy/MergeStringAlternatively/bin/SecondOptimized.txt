Create the left and right, initialize equals to zero, so these position will start at the first 
character of each word

Then check as long as the left and right positions are smaller than the word1 or word2 length. 
If the left position is smaller than the length of word1, then append the character at that position to the 
StringBuilder
If the right position is smaller than the length of word2, then append the character at that position to the
StringBuilder
