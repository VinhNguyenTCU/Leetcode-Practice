First I create StringBuilder to store my answer
Initialize left and right equals 0, at the beginning of two words

Check if both left and right smaller than the size of two words
then merge the character at position left to the character at the position right, then increase both 
left and right by 1

For the edge case, check whether word1 will end first or word2 will end first. 
Then loop through the string builder to get the StringBuilder
