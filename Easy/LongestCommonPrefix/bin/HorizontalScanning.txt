Edge Case: if the length of the String is 0/ empty/ null --> return "";

Let the first element of the array is the prefix
Then make a for loop, start from position 1 and create a while to compare with 
each element. If the prefix is not at the beginning of the element, which means the result of the 
method indexOf is not equal 0, then the element on the right side of the prefix will be removed until it is in
the beginning of the element.
