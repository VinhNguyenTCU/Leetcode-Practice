1: In this optimized method, we uses the combination of two-poiner technique and binary search 
strategy to find two numbers in a sorted array that add up to a given target.

2: Initialize an ans array which will store the result indices if they are found. Otherwise, return itself and indices -1 -1 means not found.
Initialize variable length which is the total length the input array.

left is an index starting at the beginning of the array (index 0).
right is an index starting at the end of the array (index length - 1).

--- Time Complexity ---
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n) in the worst case. The two-pointer approach ensures each element is processed at most once.
The additional checks with the middle index do not add more than constant time operations to each iteration.

--- Space Complexity --- 
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) because it uses a constant amount of extra space (variables left, right, middle, sum, and the output array ans).
