/*
 * A good interview strategy would be to mention them during the discussion but not to base the code on them. 
 * Better to use the limited interview time to work with two ideas:
 * 
 * - Sentinel nodes: Sentinel nodes are widely used in the trees and linked lists as pseudo-heads, pseudo-tails, etc.
 * They serve as the guardians, as the name suggests, nd usaully, they do not hold any data.
 * 
 * - Bidirectional search for a doubly-linked list
