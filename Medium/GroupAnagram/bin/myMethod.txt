1. Initializes HashMap name map. Where the key are sorted String (representing the sorted characters of each string in the input array) 
and the value are List of String (representing the anagrams of a specific group)

2. Create a for-each loop to iterate through each String in the given String array

3. Each string then will be converted into char Array with the method toCharArray()

4. Then use method Array.sort(). This step ensures that all anagrams of the same word will have the same sorted representation, which will
serve as the key in the map.

5. Then use the String.valueOf() to convert the char array back to the String.

6. Check whether the map contains the key or not. If the map contains key, then it will get the key, and add the new value to that key. If
the map does not contain that key, it will put a new key and a new ArrayList as value.

7. Return a new ArrayList<>(map.values());
