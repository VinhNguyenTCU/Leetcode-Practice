What are the different types of binary trees?
- Full Tree: Tree where every node have two children nodes except the leaves
- Complete Tree: Every node has at lease two children except for the bottom level, and they have to be filled in as far left as possible
- Degenerate tree: Every node only has one child node
- Perfect tree: every internal node has two children and all leaves are on the same level
- Balanced tree: height of the left and right subtree of any node differ by not more than one
